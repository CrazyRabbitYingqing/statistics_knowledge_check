### Frequentist interpretation

The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.

### Bayesian interpretation

A Bayesian interprets probability as a subjective degree of belief.

Largely popularized by revolutionary advance in computational technology and methods during the last twenty years.

### Law of large numbers

As more observations are collected, the proportion of occurrences with a particular outcome converges to the probability of that outcome.
