### Frequentist interpretation

The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.

### Bayesian interpretation

A Bayesian interprets probability as a subjective degree of belief.

Largely popularized by revolutionary advance in computational technology and methods during the last twenty years.

### Law of large numbers

As more observations are collected, the proportion of occurrences with a particular outcome converges to the probability of that outcome.

### Law of average

?

### Disjoint events

Cannot happen at the same time, mutually exclusive.

### Non-Disjoint events

Can happen at the same time.

### p-value

### descriptive statistics and inferential statistics
The purpose of Descriptive Statistics is to provide a summary of the data and its properties
Descriptive Statistics can take the form of simple metrics known as summary statistics (i.e. number of observations, minimum value, maximum value, mean, variance, etc.) or they can take the form of visualizations (i.e. histograms, scatterplots, pie charts, box plots, etc.)

The purpose of Inferential Statistics is to make inferences about a population using a subset of the population known as a sample
Inferential Statistics begin with a hypothesis about the population and then the sample is used to prove or disprove the hypoothesis, effectively inferring something about the population
